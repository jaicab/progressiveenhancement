# Progressive Enhancement.
A site for all things progressively enhanced. - [https://progressiveenhancement.org](https://progressiveenhancement.org)

I want this to be the place where people go to learn about progressive enhancement. For now categories are articles, examples, tools, talks and guidelines, but this could change. Once we have gathered enough resources, I will process the data and PRs sent, (probably) recategorise them and redesign the site (this is just a placeholder).

If there are any resources related with **progressive enhancement** that you have bookmarked or found interesting, please [submit them using this form](http://goo.gl/forms/X5fy7xpA0a), which can also be found embedded on the site.

You can also create new files as PRs on GitHub and therefore get [proper credit](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/graphs/contributors) for your help. This is the pattern for a single resource.
