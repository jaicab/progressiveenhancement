If you have any resources that you have found insteresting related with **progressive enhancement**, please [submit them using this form](http://goo.gl/forms/X5fy7xpA0a), which can also be found embedded below.

I want this to be the place where people go to learn about progressive enhancement. For now categories are articles, examples, tools, and guidelines, but this could change. After [#enhanceconf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EnhanceConf?src=hash&lang=es) I will process the data, and PRs sent categorise it and redesign the site (this is just a placeholder).

You can also create new files as PRs on GitHub and therefore get proper credit for your help. Follow [this pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/gh-pages/_resourcearticle/example.md) (site is optional) and then click on one of these links create:

- [Article](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourcearticle)
- [Example](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourceexample)
- [Tool](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourcetool)
- [Guideline](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourceguideline)
- [Other](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourceother)

If you want to contribute even more (thanks!), this site is built on Jekyll and it's all available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement), so feel free to open an issue, send a PR or tweet me at [@jaicab_](https://twitter.com/jaicab_).
