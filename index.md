title: Progressive Enhancement
---

I want this to be the place where people go to learn about progressive enhancement. For now categories are articles, examples, tools, and guidelines, but this could change. After [#enhanceconf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EnhanceConf?src=hash&lang=es), I will process the data and PRs sent categorise it and redesign the site (this is just a placeholder).

If you have any resources that you have found insteresting related with **progressive enhancement**, please [submit them using this form](http://goo.gl/forms/X5fy7xpA0a), which can also be found embedded below.

You can also create new files as PRs [on GitHub](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement) and therefore get [proper credit](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/graphs/contributors) for your help. 

Easiest way is to use the web interface. Copy [this pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/gh-pages/_resourcearticle/example.md) (site is optional) and then click on one of these links and paste it to create:

- [Article](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourcearticle): For articles that talk about progressive enhancement, the good and the bad.
- [Example](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourceexample): For tutorials/code samples/specific articles applied to a pattern where PE was applied.
- [Tool](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourcetool): A tool/service that helped you enhance the experience or that it's built with that foundation.
- [Guideline](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourceguideline): A set of rules that define how to approach work with PE, maybe from a company or a person's site.
- [Other](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement/new/gh-pages/_resourceother): Anything that doesn't apply to the others. Books, podcasts, etc. 

I will try to go through some PRs while at the conference!

If you want to contribute even more (thanks!), this site is built on Jekyll and it's all available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaicab/progressiveenhancement), so feel free to open an issue, send a PR or tweet me at [@jaicab_](https://twitter.com/jaicab_).
